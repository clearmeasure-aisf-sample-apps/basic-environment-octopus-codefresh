# Deployment freeze prod-weekend-freeze (§7.2, ADR-D5): project workorders, environment prod, every weekend.
#
# A per-project freeze is used: multi-project freezes need an Enterprise licence from 2025.2.7631, while project
# freezes are available to all customers and support recurring schedules
# (https://octopus.com/docs/deployments/deployment-freezes,
#  https://octopus.com/docs/deployments/deployment-freezes/project-deployment-freezes). Provider 1.20.0 supports
# recurring_schedule on this resource, which settles recurring support for §7.2.
# Override: users with ProjectEdit scoped to prod may override and must enter a reason in the override dialog
# (Release Managers; approvers hold Work Orders Approver without ProjectEdit, ADR-IR17). Freezes also block automatic lifecycle promotions,
# which never target prod here.
# Recurrence semantics: the first window (Saturday 00:00 to Monday 00:00) repeats weekly on Saturday
# [VERIFY that the window keeps its 48-hour length on each occurrence].
