# Environments, in order (§7.2). The names are also the slugs that OCL, accounts and Argo CD annotations use
# (argo.octopus.com/environment: tdd|uat|prod, §7.3).
#
# infra-nonprod already exists: the user created it by hand to restrict the stored provisioner account (R4).
# Import it before the first apply with an untracked imports.tf, deleted afterwards, so that no instance ID is
# committed (docs/bootstrap.md step 3):
#   import {
#     to = octopusdeploy_environment.this["infra-nonprod"]
#     id = "<infra-nonprod-environment-id>"
#   }

# sort_order starts at 1: provider 1.20.0 treats 0 as unset, and Octopus assigns its own value.
