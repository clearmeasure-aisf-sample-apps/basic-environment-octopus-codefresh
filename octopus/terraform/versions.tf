# Octopus objects that config-as-code does not store (E26): environments, lifecycles, projects and their
# version-control settings, channels, feeds, accounts, worker pools, library variable sets, teams, roles,
# service accounts, the OIDC identity, triggers and the prod freeze (platform-design §7.2, ADR-D7).
# Applied by a platform engineer from a workstation; never from a pipeline (ADR-D8: no Octopus API key in CI).
#
# Objects the user already stored are looked up by name and never created or managed:
#   account `Azure Runtime Provisioner`, library variable sets `Azure Runtime Provisioning` and
#   `GitHub AISF Sample Apps`, Git credential `GitHub clearmeasure-aisf-sample-apps` (§5.3).
