# --- Fast-burn SLO alert (ADR-D15) -----------------------------------------------------------------
# SLO: 99.5 % of ui-server requests complete without a 5xx over 28 days. Error budget 0.5 %.
# Fast burn: 2 % of the 28-day budget spent within one hour, i.e. a burn rate of
# 0.02 * (28 * 24) = 13.44, confirmed over a 5-minute window so the alert also clears quickly.
# Health, liveness and version probes are excluded so probe traffic neither dilutes nor
# triggers the rate. A minimum of 50 requests in the hour keeps a single failed request on an
# idle environment from paging.
# Response: docs/runbooks/slo-fast-burn.md.
